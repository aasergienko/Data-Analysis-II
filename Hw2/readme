**Here is the 2nd HW**

I have done several things:

1. I've created several dataframes (and then a database) from WALS CLDF dataset 
(https://github.com/cldf-datasets/wals)
2. I've manipulated these datasets a bit, creating several plots.
All the plots describe the geographic distribution of languages with case syncretism
3. Finally, I added a column of automatically glossed Turkish text into a dataset
